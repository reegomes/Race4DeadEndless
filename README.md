Race4Dead

This is a survival game.

Game being released in the best possible way based on the time (two weeks).
This is a game made in an educational institution, so there is no profit with it, feel free to play or study the code, add only the credits, please.
I would really like to improve more in the models and environment of the game, unfortunately I have no knowledge about drawing and modeling.
